            So here is my attempt to show what I've learned
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <pre>
            I'll  start  by  using  the  pre  tag  to  put  in  this  text  exactly  as  it  is  written  here  with  its  double  spaces
        </pre>
        <p>
            Here are 5 games I've been playing recently
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Apex Legends </li>
            <li> Dead By Daylight </li>
            <li> Monster Hunter: Rise </li>
            <li> Rocket League </li>
            <li> Clash Royale</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            and here are those 5 games in order of most to least favorite
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Apex Legends </li>
            <li> Rocket League </li>
            <li> Monster Hunter: Rise </li>
            <li> Dead By Daylight </li>
            <li> Clash Royale </li>
        </ol>
        <h6 style="font-size: 32px">
            I have also altered this h6 to be the same font size as h1
        </h6>
        <h1>
            Here is the actual h1!
        </h1>
        <p>
            And here I'll make these bold using the opposite of the text like this <b>strong</b> and <strong>b</strong>
            and now to do the same with itailic <em>i</em> and <i>em</i>
        </p>
