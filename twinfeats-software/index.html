            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Twin brothers Kent and Kevin Smotherman founded Twinfeats Software in 1983 with a simple premise: 
                Free software for a free world. From the beginnings on the Commodre 64 to today's Android apps, that
                vision has never waverd.

                    dozen programming languages. He enjoys teaching web development, chess, and 
                    petting the family cat, Solo (obviously) though he is not a bond villain.

                TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applications which will meet and 
                exceed expectations. We will work with you to fully understand your needs, but more 
                than that - your data. Web applications are all about data, and without deeply 
                understanding the needs of your data, your web application will suffer.
            </p>
            <h2>Web application? Huh?</h2>
            <p>
                Webs sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. A web 
                application is a web site powered by a database. Facebook is a great example of a 
                web application - the data shown varies by user and can change every single second.

            <h1>Applications</h1>
            <p>
                We've written so many applications in the last 35+ years that we literally lost count! 
                Applications like our FreedomWare line of games for the Commodore 64 are long gone, as 
                are our productivity suite for GEOS on the C64 and Amiga.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever use WebEx,GotoMeeting or Zoom teleconferencing software? We wrote our own back in 
                the 90s for not just conferencing but online learning. Our Android applications range 
                from custom games to productivity tools. Web sites and web applications? We've done 'em 
                by the dozens.
            </p>

                As we like to say, if we can't do it at TwinFeats Software, it's a hardware problem!
