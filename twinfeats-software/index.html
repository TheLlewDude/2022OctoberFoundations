            <p>
                Twin brothers Kent and Kevin Smotherman founded Twinfeats Software in 1983 with a simple premise: 
                Free software for a free world. From the beginnings on the Commodre 64 to today's Android apps, that
                vision has never waverd.

                    dozen programming languages. He enjoys teaching web development, chess, and 
                    petting the family cat, Solo (obviously) though he is not a bond villain.
